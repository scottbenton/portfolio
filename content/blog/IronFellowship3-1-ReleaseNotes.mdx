Iron Fellowship and Crew Link have been updated to version 3.1.
This update is focused around improving the experience for players playing different types of Ironsworn and Starforged campaigns.
A full [changelog](#changelog) is available below.

## Campaign Types

Whenever you create a campaign, you can now choose between three separate campaign types.

1. Solo Campaigns: These campaigns are for a single player who plays more than one character.
2. Co-op Campaigns: These campaigns are for multiple players, each playing a character with no guide.
3. Guided Campaigns (default): These campaigns are for multiple players, with one player acting as a Game Master (or guide).

Depending on which campaign type you choose, the app will adjust the experience to better suit your needs.
For example, co-op campaigns will automatically grant each new player full access to a setting shared in the campaign, while guided campaigns will only allow the guide to have such access.
Co-op and solo campaigns will also no longer see text that is only relevant for GMs in guided campaigns.

You can change the campaign type at any time from the campaign page by clicking the settings icon and selecting "Edit Campaign".
Be warned that changing the campaign type may result in some content being hidden or shown, so remember you can always change back if you are missing something!

## Visual Campaign Changes

As a part of these new changes (and to make my life easier), the campaign page has been merged with the GM screen.
Guides and co-op players will now be able to reference moves, oracles, character information, tracks, notes, and setting information all from the campaign page.
Solo players and players in guided campaigns will have a more streamlined experience, with moves, oracles, and notes being available on the character sheet instead.

As always, I am open to feedback on these changes, and I hope they make the app more enjoyable for everyone!
