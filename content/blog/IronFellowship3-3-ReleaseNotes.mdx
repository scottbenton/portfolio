## World Item Icons

As an alternative to uploading images to Locations, Lore, and NPCs, users can now choose to select an icon and a color instead.
Iron Fellowship and Crew Link include the entire icon library from [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net)

## Sectors (Crew Link Change)

The "Sectors" tab in Crew Link has been replaced by a "Locations" tab that includes all of the new mapping features described below.
Notably, this means that you can have any type of location sit at the top level, and that any type of location can now have a map.

## Maps

Maps can be added to all different location types!
Place new or existing locations on the map in order to plan out your world map.
Multiple locations can be placed on the same hex, so that if you would like to stack settlements under your planets, you can do so without needing to create a whole planet map.

You can also change the background of your maps if you desire!
You have two options for changing the background; painting, or uploading images.

Painted backgrounds allow you to use preset colors to create terrain:

While background images allow you to upload your own files to use as backgrounds:

I hope you enjoy using these new mapping features in your games!
