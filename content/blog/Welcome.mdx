Welcome to my blog! It is my hope that I can use this website to log things that I learn, both to help others and so that I can reference it later. Generally, I want to post about...

- Things I learn at work
- Things I learn working on my own
- Project releases for my projects

If you want to learn more about who I am, you can learn more about me [here](/about). If you want to see what I've been working on, visit [my github](https://github.com/scottbenton) or [my projects](/projects). Feel free to email me at scott@scottbenton.dev!
