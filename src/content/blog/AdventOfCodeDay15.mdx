This holiday season I have been participating in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
Similar to an advent calendar, each day a new problem is released to puzzle over and write a solution to.
Day 15's problem, which can be read [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/15) involved implementing a solution to calculate a specific index in Van Eck's Sequence.
Van Eck's sequence is described in more detail below.
Upon creating a solution for this problem, I found that my javascript code took a lot longer than I expected to run, despite my solution being `O(n)`.
This post describes Van Eck's Sequence, my solution for the Advent of Code problem, why I believe the performance issues occurred, and how I fixed them.

## Van Eck's Sequence

This sequence generates new numbers by finding the previous occurrence of the current number in the sequence.
If the current number has never been in the sequence before, the next number will be 0.
Otherwise it will be the difference between the two indexes.
There is a walkthrough of the first 5 numbers in the sequence below.

```
0 <- Starting here, 0 has not occurred elsewhere, so we will add 0
0 0 <- The difference between these two 0's is 1, so let's add that
0 0 1 <- 1 has not occurred elsewhere, add 0
0 0 1 0 <- the difference between the last two 0's is 2, so let's add that
0 0 1 0 2
... continue the sequence
```

## Advent of Code Solution

The Advent of Code problem (again, detailed [here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/15)) involved continuing Van Eck's sequence from a starter array and finding the `nth` number of the sequence.
My solution works in `O(n)` time, as instead of performing a search to find the last index of the current value, I stored the last index for a given value in a Javascript Object.
Then all we need to do to generate the next number in a sequence is to find the difference between the current index, and the index stored in the object, if it exists, or set the number to 0 if it doesn't.

## Performance Issues & Solutions

The solution above worked fine for part 1, where `n = 2020`, but broke down for part 2, where `n = 30,000,000`.
After researching Van Eck's sequence, and coming to the conclusion that `O(n)` was the best I could do for this problem, I figured the performance issues must be coming from Javascript.
I quickly implemented and ran the same solution in Python, and the code that had taken minutes to run in Javascript took only seconds in Python.
While I had expected a difference, I had not expected this large of one.

Heading back to the Javascript code, I decided to see if using maps instead of objects could solve the performance problems.
Switching out the object syntax for the map syntax, I reran the code and saw a large difference.

| Solution Type | Execution Time              |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| Object        | 12 minutes and 52.6 seconds |
| Map           | 7.9 seconds                 |

## Potential Causes

Despite solving the performance issues, I wanted to learn why this issue was occurring.

I first wondered if I had a memory leak somewhere, and wanted to see how much memory was being used by each function.
I called `process.memoryUsage().heapUsed` within each function, and got the results below.

| Solution Type | Heap Used |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Object        | 1638 MB   |
| Map           | 709 MB    |

While the Object function used a little more than twice the memory, it is not drastic enough to be a memory leak, and isn't large enough to be causing issues of this magnitude.

Looking around online, I saw some discussion about memory reallocation for Objects causing performance problems.
To test this, I added some console messages every million items.
The first few console messages printed out within seconds, and each subsequent one took longer and longer.
While this isn't necessarily a memory reallocation issue - I suppose it could also be that accessing a value in an object isn't `O(n)`, I believe that the slowing performance does point to memory reallocation being the problem.

Therefore, when working with large sets of data in Javascript, I would recommend using Maps rather than Objects, as the performance is greatly improved.
