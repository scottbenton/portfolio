Caching important, repeated calls to the API is a good method of ensuring that your web application performs quickly on repeat visits to the site, despite network conditions. Using a cache can also help you implement offline functionality for your progressive web application. For work, I recently needed to implement a **stale while revalidate** cache strategy to ensure that some key calls displayed feedback to the user quickly, while still updating in the background in case anything had changed.

Since this is a feature we may want for multiple API calls, lets take a look at using [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to create this functionality, as well as the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for values you need available across your application.

It is important to note that I will use `axios` for making requests throughout this example, but you can do the same thing using `fetch` or any other API call of your choice.

## Caching Policy

In our case, we wanted the browser to kick off two concurrent calls whenever the user accessed a cached resource. One call should be made to the Browser Cache. Since resource is local, it should return almost immediately, and update the UI to display these values. Since these values could be out of date, we call them "stale". If this is a user's first time visiting the website, there will be no cached values yet, so it is important to note that the cache only effects subsequent API calls.

The other call will go to the API. This is our revalidation call. If we get a response back, and there are new values, we want to update the UI with these new values, as well as updating the browser's cache.


## Function Implementation

Since we will need the same stale while revalidate logic in multiple examples here today, lets extract it out to a function called `staleWhileRevalidate`. This function will take in a url and a callback function. This callback function will accept two parameters - data, and an overwrite boolean to know if the data present should overwrite any existing data. We require the overwrite boolean so that we don't run into any race conditions between our API and Cache.

```javascript
function staleWhileRevalidate(url, updateValues) {
  // Ensure cache api exists for the current browser
  if (window.caches) {
    // Open the cache and find data for the current URL
    caches.open("api-cache").then((cache) => {
      cache.match(url).then((response) => {
        // If the cache has a response cached, convert it and call the callback function
        if (response) {
          response.json().then((data) => {
            // We pass false here so we the caller knows not to overwrite any existing API values
            updateValues(data, false);
          });
        }
      });
    });
  }

  // Make the API call
  axios.get(url).then((response) => {
    // Make sure were no errors fetching the data
    if (response.ok) {
      // We pass true so the caller knows to overwrite the cached values
      updateValues(response.data, true);
    }

    // Update the cache
    if (window.caches) {
      caches.open("api-cache").then((cache) => {
        // Convert Axios Response to a Fetch Response
        // Note that if you use fetch(), this step is unnecessary.

        // Turn our response into a json blob
        const blob = new Blob([JSON.stringify(response.data, null)], {
          type: "application/json",
        });
        // store the status from our response
        const init = { status: response.status };

        // Construct a new fetch response and store it in the cache.
        cache.put(url, new Response(blob, init));
      });
    }
  });
}
```

## Basic Hook Implementation

Since this is a feature we may want to integrate into multiple components, lets create a hook for it. We want this hook to take in a url and to run through the stale while revalidate process to return the value back to the UI.

```javascript
function useCache(url) {
  // We will store our values in a state, so it triggers a re-render when they change
  const [state, setState] = React.useState();

  // Arrow function to help us handle updating logic
  const handleStateUpdate = (data, shouldOverwrite) => {
    // We use a setState callback to ensure that we aren't comparing against an out of date version of state
    setState((prevState) => {
      // Only set the data if we should overwrite or no data currently exists
      return shouldOverwrite || !prevState ? data : prevState;
    });
  };

  // Call our helper function
  staleWhileRevalidate(url, setState);

  // Return the values to the UI
  return state;
}
```

Now that we've created our hook, we can use it to cache api calls. Here is an example of how this would work.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  // We have an array of dogs that we want quickly, but also want to eventually get the most up to date values for.
  const dogs = useCache("/api/dogs");

  return (
    <>
      {dogs &&
        dogs.map((dog, index) => (
          <span key={index}>{dog.name} is a very good dog</span>
        ))}
    </>
  );
}
```
