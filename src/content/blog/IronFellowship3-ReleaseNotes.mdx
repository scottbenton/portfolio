Iron Fellowship and Crew Link version 3.0.0 is here!
This update is focused around improving support for homebrew content, and paving the way for adding Sundered Isles support.
A full [changelog](#changelog) is available below.

## Using the new Homebrew System

Instead of adding homebrew content in separate areas of the app, I've centralized it with the new homebrew library.
This library allows you to create expansions to the base games, allowing you to group homebrew content such as new stats, condition meters, moves, oracles, assets, and more.
These expansions can be shared with others, either directly or through campaigns if you are playing together.

### Creating an Expansion

To create a new homebrew expansion, navigate to the Homebrew Page, and click "Create a Collection". Give your collection a descriptive name, and click "Create Expansion".

### Adding Content to an Expansion

After you have created your expansion, you should be able to open it up and begin adding content.
Content can be added from the four main content tabs - Rules, Moves, Oracles, and Assets.

In the rules tab, you can add new stats, condition meters, impacts, or legacy tracks.

The moves, oracles, and assets tab all work fairly similarly.
In each tab, you can create a new collection to group your content.
These collections present three main ways of organizing your content.

A collection can...

1. be its own separate collection, containing all of the content you want to group together.
2. enhance an existing collection, adding its contents to the existing collection.
3. overwrite an existing collection, replacing all the contents within.

Once you have created a collection, you can add content to it.
This content can also replace existing content - for example, you can create a homebrew move that replaces the "Face Danger" move.

### Enabling an Expansion

Once you have created an expansion, you need to enable it for your characters and campaigns.

If your character is _not_ in a campaign, or you are the GM of your campaign, you can enable the expansion from your character sheet by clicking on the character settings icon, and selecting "Expansions and Homebrew".
If you are the GM of a campaign, you can also enable the expansion from the GM screen, under the "Settings" tab.

### Sharing an Expansion

If you are playing in a campaign, other players will automatically see the homebrew content on their character sheets.
However, if you would like to invite other community members to read or help edit your homebrew, you can do that on the homebrew page.

Viewers will be able to view and use your homebrew content in their own campaigns, but cannot make any changes to it.
Editors, in addition to being able to view the content, can also make changes to it, so be careful when sharing your content!
