As of today, the Iron Link Beta is available for testing!

Join your crew and traverse the Ironlands, explore the Forge, or sail the seas of the Sundered Isles.
Iron Link is a platform for playing Ironsworn or Starforged, both tabletop roleplaying games by Shawn Tomkin.

## Features

Iron Link carries over many of the features from Iron Fellowship and Crew Link, including:

* Synced play across multiple devices
* Group play with different setups for Solo, Co-op, and Guided modes.
* Easy reference to moves, oracles, and assets

It is currently missing some features present in Iron Fellowship and Crew Link, such as worlds and homebrew.
These features will make their way into Iron Link in the future.

### New Features

#### Layout

Iron Link places a greater emphasis on the notes and fiction of your game.
The notes section is now centered on the screen, with character and reference materials available in a sidebar.
In multi-character games, you can now quickly and easily switch between characters using the tabs at the top of the page.

#### Notes

With the greater focus on notes, the notes section has been expanded to include more features.

You can group your using folders, and choose to share folders or individual notes with other players.

You can now insert images into your notes to help illustrate your fiction.

Rolls can also be pasted directly into your notes, allowing you to keep a record of your gameplay alongside your fiction.
A big thank you to the [Iron Vault](https://ironvault.quest/) team for inspiring this feature!

### Themes

In addition to light and dark modes, Iron Link also supports themes.
Themes allow you to give each game or character a unique color scheme, making it easier to differentiate between them.

### New Bugs!

Along with all of the new features, I have also taken the liberty of adding a number of new bugs.
If you come across any issues, let me know!
I can't fix what I don't know is a problem.

You can report issues or suggestions either through our channel on the [official discord](https://discord.gg/8bRuZwK) (#iron-fellowship-and-crew-link), by opening an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/scottbenton/Iron-Link/issues), or by emailing me at scott@scottbenton.dev.

## What's Next?

There is still much more to come for Iron Link. Here are some of the features that are planned to be added soon!

### Worlds

The ability to create locations, NPCs, and more is a feature that I want to bring to Iron Link.
I have a few ideas on how to expand upon the features from Iron Fellowship and Crew Link, and I will be reaching out for feedback on the discord server as I begin this work.

### Homebrew

Adding custom content is a vital feature for many players, and I want to make it easier to import and export your creations in the datasworn format.
However, this feature is going to wait until datasworn has its next stable release.

### Offline Mode

Adding an offline mode is a feature that will take a lot of time to implement correctly.
While I wasn't able to include it in this release, I want to make sure that any future offline mode does not compromise the synced play experience or risk losing your data.

### Public Sharing

I want Iron Link to be a platform where you can share your fiction with the community.
