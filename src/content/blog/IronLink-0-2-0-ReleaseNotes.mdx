Howdy Folks!

Iron Link Beta 0.2.0 is here, and it brings with it two new features: Playsets and the Cursed Die.

## Features

Playsets offer a way to customize your game by selecting the moves, oracles, and assets that you want to use.

Want to run a Starforged game, using the recommended assets from Sundered Isles?
We have a preset for that!

Want to hide all of the space-themed oracles in your Sundered Isles game?
Go for it!

In addition, editing your playset when you have the **Sundered Isles** Expansion enabled will allow you to select whether or not you want to automatically roll your cursed die.
On oracles with cursed variants, your cursed die will automatically be rolled, and if selected, will offer you a cursed result.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where replacement moves (like `Repair` from Sundered Isles) were not properly overwriting their base moves.
- Fixed the Exploration Move Category appearing twice.
- Fixed a bug that prevented oracles added by assets and moves from being rolled.
- Fixed a bug that prevented moves added by assets from being added to the reference sidebar.

## What's Next?

Beta 0.3.0 will focus on adding worlds into Iron Link.
I am looking for feedback on how best to implement this feature, so please feel free to reach out with your opinions on discord!
